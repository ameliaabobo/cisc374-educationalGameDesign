# Game Name

Passport: A Game of World Religions

## Elevator Pitch

Religions across the world have countless similarities but it is easier for everyone to point out the differences. This divides society and can lead to hate crimes and unnecessary violence. This game will educate players about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with the hope of religious diversity. 


## Influences (Brief)

- *Influence #1*:
  - Medium: Baker Institute's research article "Faith-Based Diplomacy: Bridging the Religious Divide" 
  - Explanation: "One wonders why it is that these two world religions, which share so much in common theologically - and they go - either talk past one another at best or, alternatively, resort to conflict to settle their differences." 
- *Influence #2*:
  - Medium: Personal knowledge/experiences
  - Explanation: Society uses religion as a dividing factor among people. Through education people can see the similarities in belief systems. 


## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Completion bar partially fills if player reaches religious leader.
